A place for shell scrips for installing software easily.

Setup for Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 mainly but with support for Debian Buster/Bookworm as applicable.

Future improvements - add a auto descovery element to script to auto select OS and find this. 

How to:
git pull to desired location. Add the script to /tmp
chmod +x /tmp/script_name.sh 
./tmp/script_name.sh 

Depending on the script it might be better to reboot the box when completed.
